/*
This CSS file imports Tailwind CSS styles, which are a set of utility classes for rapidly building modern web interfaces. 
These utility classes provide a wide range of styling options for elements, such as margins, paddings, colors, and more.

@tailwind base; 
- Imports base styles like normalize.css, which provide basic styles for elements to ensure consistent rendering across browsers.

@tailwind components; 
- Imports component-specific styles, such as buttons, forms, and other UI components.

@tailwind utilities; 
- Imports utility classes, which are small, single-purpose classes that can be combined to achieve desired styles. 
  Utilities cover a wide range of styling options, including layout, typography, spacing, and responsiveness.

Tailwind CSS follows a utility-first approach, where styles are applied directly to HTML elements using utility classes, 
which can lead to faster development and more maintainable code.
